# List Central

Welcome to List Central, a repository containing a collection of useful lists for programmers. Inside, you will find a variety of lists, including:

- A list of all English words
- A list of headwords
- A list of prime numbers

Each list is stored in its own folder, with both JSON and text versions available for most lists.

This repository may be particularly useful for those working on natural language processing or other projects that require access to a wide range of words or numbers.

All of the files in this repository are available for use without any copyright restrictions. While it is not strictly necessary, we would appreciate a mention if you find any of the lists useful in your projects.

We welcome requests for new list ideas, so feel free to let us know if there is something you would like to see added to this repository.
